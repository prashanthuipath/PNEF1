  <p>Dear Team member,</p>
  <p>We have attempted e-filing the tax returns submitted for e-filing through the iACE. For the successful e-filing, we needed the correct password to access the assignee's efiling portal account. The Robotic Process Innovation Tool ('Bot') has compared the new JSON generated from the Income tax Department's utility with the JSON generated by iACE for the following factors -</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Total Income</li>
    <li>Tax Liability</li>
    <li>Refund Due</li>
    <li>Carried Forward Loss amount</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Unfortunately, due to a mismatch in any of the above factors or for some other reason, the e-filing attempt was not successful. We have attached the screenshot generated displaying the reason for failure, for your reference.</p>

  <p>You could re-assess the need for correcting the error and re-submitting for e-filing once again through the iACE. While the screenshot is self-explanatory, in case you need any assistance in understanding the error, please reach out to Manjunath KT/ Ravindran R for the same.</p>

  <p>Best regards,</p>
