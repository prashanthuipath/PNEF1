    <p>Dear All,</p>
    <p>We are happy to inform you that your 2022-23 India (In) Income Tax Return has been electronically filed with the Income
        Tax Department (acknowledgement uploaded in your myMobility account for your reference).</p>
    <p>Password to open the document is your Date of Birth in ddmmyyyy format.</p>
    <p>Next action required from you: e-verification of your filed Income Tax Return (guide attached below)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The time limit for e-verification is 30 days from the date of filing your tax return. Failure to e-verify within
            the prescribed timeline will lead to your tax return being considered invalid and may also have monetary
            consequences.</li>
        <li>Please login to your e-filing account on <a href="https://www.incometax.gov.in/iec/foportal/">https://www.incometax.gov.in/iec/foportal/</a>
            and follow the steps mentioned in the guide to e-verify your Income Tax Return.</li>
        <li>Post e-verification, share with us the Form ITR-V (acknowledgment for having filed your Income Tax Return) once
            you have completed the process.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What if you are unable to e-verify?</p>
    <p>There is an alternative mechanism for physical filing of documents, but the time limit has now been shortened to 30
        days instead of the erstwhile 120 days. Hence, please opt for this process only if you are confident of the signed
        documents positively reaching the tax department within the deadline of 30 days from the actual date of filing
        your tax return (as reflected in Form ITR-V).</p>
    <p>In this regard, we request you to:</p>
    <ul>
